I usedcreate-react-app to help us bootstrap the React App for us.
"npm install create-react-app"

Running the above command would install create-react-app in our project. Now, this would be ready for use.

To create a new project named ‘todo’, we would run the command as follows:
"create-react-app todo"
Now, this would create a folder named ‘todo’ in our current repository. Next, we should move inside the todo folder by doing:
"npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap"

Running the above command will install both react-bootstrap and bootstrap libraries in our application.
Now, we are ready to build the app.
